PREFACE
Efficient combat operations depend on clear, accurate, and secure communication among ground units, Army aviation, and supporting Air Force elements. Control and coordination are achieved by the most rapid means of communication available between men and units. When electrical means of communication are inadequate, or not available, a station-to-station system of visual communication is an alternate means for transmitting orders, information, or requests for aid and/or support.
Through the use of arm-and-hand signals, flags, pyrotechnics, and other visual aids, messages may be transmitted. Although many of these signals are widely used, incorporated into unit communica­ tions-electronics operating instructions and standing operating pro­ cedures, Army wide standardization will increase their effectiveness.
The purpose of this manual is to standardize visual signals and to serve as a training reference.
It is a guide. It does not cover all visual signals used in the Army, only those that are commonly used. Signals used with equipment (for example, mortar) or during operations (for example, pathfinder, jumpmaster) are in manuals that relate to such operations.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1-1. General
Visual signals are any means of communication that require sight and can be used to transmit prearranged messages rapidly over short dis- tances. This includes the devices and means used for the recognition and identification of friendly forces.
1-2. Types of Visual Signals
The most common types of visual signals are arm-and-hand, flag, pyrotechnic, and ground-to-air signals. However, soldiers are not limited to the types of signals discussed and may use what is avail- able. Chemical light sticks, flashlights, and other items can be used provided their use is standardized within a unit and understood by soldiers and units working in the area. The only limit is the sol- dier’s initiative and imagination.
1-3. Limitations
Visual signals have certain limitations
a.	The range and reliability of visual communications are significant- ly reduced during periods of poor visibility and when terrain restricts observation.
b.	They may be misunderstood.
c.	They are vulnerable to enemy interception and may be used for deception purposes.

CHAPTER 2
Arm-and-Hand Signals for Ground Forces
2-1. General
Signals illustrated with a single arrowhead indicate that the signal is not continuously repeated; however, it may be repeated at intervals until acknowledged or the desired action is executed. Signals il- lustrated with double arrowheads are repeated continuously until ac- knowledged or the desired action is taken. Signals are illustrated as normally seen by the viewer. Some signals are illustrated in oblique, right angle, or overhead views for clarity.
2-2. Signals to Control Vehicle Drivers and/or Crews
These are the arm-and-hand and light signals used to guide and direct vehicles. Flashlights are used at night to direct vehicles. Blue filters should be used whenever possible in order to preserve the driver’s night vision. Chemical lights can also be used and have less effect on the driver’s night vision (Figures 2-1 through 2-22).

2-3. Signals for Crew-Served Weapons
Members of crew-served weapons must communicate. Often, this is in environments where visual signals are the best means of trans- mitting information (Figures 2-23 through 2-28).

Leaders of dismounted units use arm-and-hand signals to control the movement of individuals, teams, and squads. These signals are used by infantry and also by combat sup- port and combat service support elements organized for in- fantry missions (Figures 2-29 through 2-45).
Leaders of mounted units use arm-and-hand signals to con- trol individual vehicles and platoon movement. When dis- tances between vehicles increase, flags (wrapped and tied) can be used as an extension of the arm to give the sig- nals. From some vehicles (for example, Bradley, M2), the arm-and-hand signals will be distorted (Figures 2-46 through 2-50).
Signals for drills are illustrated in Figures 2-51 through 2-57.

2-5. Patrolling Arm-and-Hand Signals
Patrolling is conducted by many type units. Infantry units patrol in order to conduct combat operations. Other units patrol for reconnais- sance and security. Successful patrols require clearly understood communication signals among members of a patrol (Figures 2-58 through 2-63).

2-6. Signals to Control Convoys
a.	Traffic Control. These signals are normally used by authorized officials (civilian and military police, and personnel at traffic con- trol points) to direct traffic. At night, these signals are given with a flashlight or a lighted wand (Figures 2-64 through 2-68).

2—25
 
 
2—26
 
b.	Convoy Control. In addition to traffic control personnel, con- voy commanders can use arm-and-hand signals to convey mes- sages (Figures 2-69 through 2-72).






























2—27
 
 




2-7. Signals for Recovery Operations
Although recovery operations normally involve maintenance person- nel who know the arm-and-hand signals required, all soldiers should be familiar with some basic signals in order to assist in recovery (Figures 2-73 through 2-80).

CHAPTER 3
FLAG SIGNALS FOR ARMORED AND MECHANIZED UNITS
3-1. GENERAL
a.	Flags are issued to armored and mechanized units for control purposes and as an alternate means of communication within these units. Each combat vehicle is equipped with a flag set con- sisting of one red, one yellow, and one green flag. Flag signals may be given by using a single flag or a combination of two or three flags, according to a prearranged code. Flag signals, when understood, are repeated and executed at once (Figures 3-1 through 3-7).
b.	Flags are used to:
(1)	Mark vehicle positions. For example, a quartering party member uses colored flags in an assembly area to mark positions.
(2)	Identify disabled vehicles.
(3)	Warn friendly elements of an advancing enemy. For ex- ample, an observation post uses a flag to signal a platoon to move to its fighting position.
(4)	Control movement. Flags serve as an extension of arm-and- hand signals when distances between vehicles become too great.
c.	When used alone, flag colors have the following meanings.
(1)	Red – DANGER, or ENEMY IN SIGHT.
(2)	Green – ALL CLEAR, READY, or UNDERSTOOD.
(3)	Yellow –  DISREGARD, or VEHICLE OUT OF AC- TION.
d.	During periods of limited visibility flashlights with colored filters or colored chemical lights maybe substituted for flags.

3-2. Firing Range Flag Signals
Signal flags are used on firing ranges for tanks or fighting vehicles to indicate the status of the range and the status of the individual vehicle. A red flag at the control point indicates that firing may be conducted, wide a green flag indicates that it may not (Figures 3-8 through 3-12).

CHAPTER 4
PYROTECHNICS
4-1. GENERAL
Pyrotechnics produce either smoke or light and are consumed in the process. When used for communications, prearranged or prescribed signals are developed and used throughout a unit. These signals are developed based on the color and characteristics of the pyrotechnic device used. Pyrotechnic signals supplement or replace normal means of communication and allow a large number of troops and/or isolated units to be signaled quickly. They can be used for friendly unit identification, maneuver element control, fire support control, target marking, and location reports. When pyrotechnics are used, the signal and its meaning are included in the command and signal portion of the operation order and in the unit’s com- munications-electronics operating instructions.
WARNING
DO NOT DISCHARGE PYROTECHNICS IN THE VICINITY OF AIRCRAFT FLYING IN THE AREA.
4-2. Description
Pyrotechnics are usually issued as complete rounds. There are two common types of military pyrotechnics used for signaling--hand- held devices and ground smoke. (The M203 grenade launcher can fire pyrotechnic rounds; see FM 23-31.)
4-3. Handheld Signals
a.	Handheld signals are rocket-propelled, fin-stabilized, and consist of three concentric tubes. The outer tube is the container, the next is the launcher, and inside the launcher is the fin-stabilized tube containing the rocket propellant and signal element. When fired, the fin-stabilized tube is lifted about 50 feet in the air, the signal element is expelled, and it burns from 4 to 42 seconds, (depending upon the type of signal: cluster, or parachute devices).

4–1
 
b.	The following types of handheld signal rockets are available.
(1)	Star Clusters. Star clusters are used for signaling and il- luminating. They are issued in an expendable launcher that consists of a launching tube and a firing cap. These sig- nals produce a cluster of five free-falling pyrotechnic stars. Star clusters are available in green, red, and white (Figure 4- 1).


(2)	Star parachutes. Star parachutes are used for signaling and illuminating. They are issued in an expendable launch- er that consists of a launching tube and a firing cap. These signals produce a single parachute-suspended illuminant star. Star parachutes are available in green, red, and white (Figure 4-2).





4–2
 
 


(3)	Smoke parachutes. Smoke parachutes are used for signaling only. They are issued in an expendable launcher that con- sists of a launching tube and a firing cap. The device is a perforated cannister that is parachute-suspended. They are available in green, yellow, and red smoke.
4-4. Ground Smoke
a.	Smoke may be used for both ground and ground-to-air signal- ing. Both white and colored smoke may be used for this purpose. Smoke signals are visible over greater distances when employed against a terrain background of contrasting color. Smoke is valu- able for marking unit flanks, positions of lead elements, locations of targets, drop zones, tactical landing areas, and medical evacua- tion landing sites. Smoke signals are not suitable for messages, but are applicable when communicating by prearranged signals between small units and with aircraft. Smoke signals may be ob- served by the enemy; therefore, due regard for secrecy must be

4–3
 
considered to try and avoid disclosing position locations and/or a unit’s intentions.
b.	Smoke grenades are available in white, green, yellow, red, and violet smoke. This color range is provided by two types of grenades.
 
(1)





(2)
 
The white smoke hand grenade is a burning-type grenade used for signaling and for laying smoke screens. When ig- nited, it produces dense white smoke for 105 to 150 seconds. It will not normally injure exposed troops. In heavy con- centrations, troops should wear the field protective mask. However, the mask will not protect against heavy concentra- tions of this smoke in enclosed spaces due to oxygen deple- tion and carbon monoxide buildup.
The M18 colored smoke grenade is similar in appearance to the white smoke grenade, but its top is painted the color of the smoke it produces. Its filler is a burning-type mixture containing a dye; only four are standard: red, green, violet, and yellow. As a burning-type grenade, it has an igniting- type fuse, and burns 50 to 90 seconds.

CHAPTER 5
SIGNALS TO AIRCRAFT
5-1. General
With the introduction of the airplane and helicopter to the combined arms team, a new requirement for communication was added to the battlefield. Ground troops and air forces need to communicate. There will be times when radios cannot be used and visual signals must be used. Therefore, systems of standard visual signals have been developed to allow ground-to-air communication. These sys- tems include arm-and-hand signals used by ground forces to direct helicopters in direct support; devices that can be used to communi- cate with aircraft; and ground-to-air emergency signals and codes.
5-2 Arm-and-Hand Ground Signals
Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are often used to support ground forces by moving supplies and/or personnel. Often, pathfinder per- sonnel will not be available to direct aircraft in support of these ef- forts. Therefore, the responsibility to guide aircraft will fall upon the ground forces. To be prepared for this effort, the soldier must know these general signals (Figures 5-1 through 5-22).

5-3. Ground-to-Air Panel System
a.	The panel system is a method ground troops use to communicate, to a limited degree, with aircraft by displaying panels on the ground. There are two types of panels: marking and identify- ing colored panels, and black and white panels for transmitting messages.
(1)	The marking and identifying panels are made in fluorescent colors. The panels are used to mark positions and identify friendly units. These panels can be ordered through the supply system using the nomenclature Panel Marker, Aerial, Liaison (Figure 5-23).
(2)	Black and white panel sets are arranged on light or dark ter- rain backgrounds. They are used to transmit brief messages or to identify a unit. This is done by using the combined panel system and the panel recognition code in the unit’s communications-electronics operating instructions.
b.	Panels (if constructed locally) should be large enough to permit easy reading from the air. There should be as much color con- trast as possible between the symbols and the background. Panels should beat least six feet long and two feet wide.
c.	Select a relatively flat, clear area of ground about 40 by 130 feet. This area is large enough to display messages and special signs. For message drop and pickup, the area should be clear of obstacles which could prevent aircraft from flying into the wind at reduced airspeed and low altitude.
d.	When using the panel system, one of the panels is used as a base panel. Place the base panels first and keep them in place as long as panel signaling is in progress. The distance between panels is one panel length throughout, when space is available. Change from one panel figure to another as soon as possible by shifting, adding, or removing panels (other than the base panels). The index panel is the first removed and the last laid out when the display is changed. Remove all panels from view that are not used for a particular display.




5—9
 
 
e.	The unit’s communications-electronics operating instructions as- sign specific vocabulary, receipting, acknowledging, and iden- tification procedures. Code meanings are normally based on this manual, with local amplification, while the numbers associated with the meanings are determined by the unit’s communications- electronics operating instructions. They are changed periodically to prevent compromise.
f.	An aircraft pilot indicates that ground signals have been under- stood by rocking the wings laterally, by flashing a green signal lamp, or by any prearranged signal (A, Figure 5-24). The pilot indicates that ground signals are not understood by making a 360- degree turn to the right, by flashing a red signal lamp, or by any prearranged signal (B, Figure 5-24). Each panel display is ac- knowledged. A pilot requests a unit to display an identification code by a prearranged signal. In no case does a unit display an identification code until the aircraft has been identified as friend- ly.

5—10
 
 
g.	Ground units can identify themselves as friendly elements to a pilot by using a panel marker or its equivalent. This panel marker is displayed on combat vehicles to identify the vehicle as friend- ly to the pilot. It is also displayed on the ground for other pur- poses; for example, to identify friendly front lines and dismounted troops. The color and pattern of the display are prescribed in unit standing operating procedures.
5-4. Special Panel Signals
a.	Wind-T. The T is used to indicate wind direction. It represents an aircraft flying into the wind. The wind-T is two panels wide and two panels long (Figure 5-25).


5—11
 
b.	Message Pickup. This message is displayed by the figure 8 (H) with the wind-T centered below it. The crossbar of the H (8) is not placed in position until the message is ready to be picked up. The pickup poles are placed so that each pole is one panel-length away from the comer of the nearest panel (Figure 5-26).

c.	Message Drop. When a dropped message is not found, this sym- bol is displayed in the drop area (Figure 5-27).


5—12
 
d.	Enemy Aircraft. Two panels, placed at right angles to a third and on the axis of any base panel, always means enemy aircraft near– even though other parts of the panel display remain in place (Figure 5-28).



e.	Direction Indicator. An arrow made with not less than four panels means “in this direction.” This sign is used alone or with the pattern preceding it to complete its meaning (Figure 5-29).

5—13
 
5-5. Ground-to-Air Emergency Signals and Codes
a.	Two Methods. Aviators have developed two methods of transmit- ting emergency messages once a pilot’s attention has been ob- tained.
b.	Emergency Signals. The body can be used to transmit mes- sages. The individual stands in an open area to make the sig- nals. He ensures that the background (as seen from the air) is not confusing, goes through the motions slowly, and repeats each sig- nal until it has been understood (Figure 5-30).
Need Medical Assistance.
Land Here.
Pick Us Up.
Do Not Attempt to Land Here.


5—14
 
c.	Emergency Codes. The symbols for these codes may be con- structed from any available material that contrasts with the back- ground; for example, strips of parachute canopy, undershirts torn into wide strips, rocks, sticks, and foliage stripped from trees. Once laid out, these signals (codes) are semipermanent (Figure 5- 31).



5—15
 
5-6. Signaling With Mirrors and Strobes
a.	Mirrors. These are used to get the attention of an aircraft pilot during the day. Their use requires good visibility and lit- tle or no cloud cover in order to reflect the sun. Mirrors can also be used to transmit messages, if signals have been arranged. The MK 3 signal mirror is designed for use as a signal device. In- structions for its use are printed on the back of the mirror (Figure 5-32).


5—16
 
b.	Strobes. These can be used at night to identify positions. If prior coordination has been conducted with supporting aviation units, strobes may also be used to signal pilots. In order to reduce detection when used, strobe lights should be placed in holes so they can only be viewed from above. Strobes with infrared covers can be used if there has been prior coordination with the aircrew. Strobes are ordered using the nomenclature Distress Markers.
